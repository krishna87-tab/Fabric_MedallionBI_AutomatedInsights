🧩 Behind the Scenes

✅ 1. Architecture Summary
This dashboard follows Microsoft Fabric’s medallion architecture. 
Raw CSVs are ingested into the Bronze Lakehouse, cleaned in the Silver Warehouse, and curated in the Gold Warehouse with a Date table. 
The semantic model connects via DirectQuery for real-time insights.

✅ 2. Pipeline Flow
A Fabric Data Pipeline automates ingestion, transformation, and semantic refresh across all layers. 
Each step is modular and monitored, ensuring reliable data delivery and KPI accuracy.

✅ 3. Troubleshooting Wins
During development, I resolved schema mismatches between Dataflow Gen2 and Warehouse, 
rebuilt the Date table to support Month Sort and time intelligence, 
and optimized DirectQuery performance through semantic modeling best practices.

✅ 4. KPI Logic Highlights
KPIs like YoY Growth, YoY %, and KPI vs Target are powered by custom DAX measures. 
These metrics enable executive storytelling and performance tracking across fiscal periods.
